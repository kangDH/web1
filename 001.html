  ​<p><br>As we close this crazy 2020, we look back on what happened during the year,
    <br>from the buildings that left an impact, to the fast changing trends
    <br>in the profession and in our built environment.

<br>But as we prepare for a challenging 2021 I want to share our reflections on these intense moments,
<br>which are not just a consequence of the pandemic, but also of the diverse and much needed social and cultural changes
<br>that have been unfolding during the last years. As a young and diverse Internet company,
<br>with a conscious and globally distributed team, we have been working during the last years to embrace change,
<br>as we think it is one of the attitudes that can prepare us for world that is changing fast,
<br>on the intersection of two of the industries that are shaping society today: Internet and the built environment.
<br>To be ready for change is not easy, as we need to constantly challenge ourselves and our egos,
<br>and do things in new ways, in new contexts. But as 2020 demanded, we were ready.</p>
